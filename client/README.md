# Rect Native client for Availability

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This is a React Native app that consumes the GraphQL API provided by the code in
`server/` built to support iOS and Android. To get started you should probably
read the [React Native website](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

The app was originally built using the wonderful
[Chatty](https://github.com/srtucker22/chatty)
[tutorial](https://medium.com/react-native-training/building-chatty-a-whatsapp-clone-with-react-native-and-apollo-part-1-setup-68a02f7e11).

It uses:
* The [GraphQL](http://graphql.org) protocol to talk to the server
* [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) to manage
  interactions with GraphQL
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org) to store state on the client
* [Geolocation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/geolocation.html)
  as built into React Native


## Install

To get started you'll need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) with
your favourite package manager. Then install yarn:
```sh
npm install -g yarn
```

Install the react-native CLI tool:
```sh
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

Now clone the repo and cd to `client`:
```sh
git clone ...
cd availability-poc/client
```

Install dependencies:
```sh
yarn
```

If this doesn't work or something is missing you may want to check the React
Native guide for **Building Projects with Native Code**
[here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html).

At this point you have all the build tools you need to package the app but to
actually compile it for Android or iOS you'll need to install the associated
toolchains.

For iOS you must be running macOS and you should install the latest version of
Xcode. Make sure you have opened it at least once to install the command-line
development tools and accept the license agreement.

For Android download Android Studio, install and then use SDK Manager to
install an Android SDK and emulator.

From here you should probably follow the platform-specific instructions
[here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device.html).
Even if you're just planning on running in the simulator/emulator you'll need
to follow these steps because our app requires custom native code.

Our project was built with `react-native init`.

For iOS you should be able to build and get running in the simulator with:
```sh
react-native run-ios
```

For Android you must create an AVD (Android Virtual Device) in Android Studio
and boot it in the emulator. Then you can build and run the app with:
```sh
react-native run-android
```


## Modifying native code

You can modify the files directly in the [`android/`](./android) or [`ios/`](./ios)
as needed to make changes to the apps you cannot make through React Native
directly. Where possible you should try to avoid this, though.

We can re-create the files in those directories using:
```sh
react-native eject
```
but this will cause all of these customisations to be lost so only do this if
you're prepared to rebase the changes on top of the fresh ejected project files.


## Deploy

Both the Android and iOS apps are currently configured to fetch updated React
Native JS bundles using [CodePush](http://microsoft.github.io/code-push/),
configured to use [@sdunster](https://github.com/sdunster)'s account.

New bundles can be built and deployed using code-push:
```sh
yarn run push-android
yarn run push-ios
```

To actually build and deploy the APK (Android) or IPA (iOS) you'll want to
follow the same
[instructions](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device.html)
from above but look for 'Building for production'.

## Configuration

You can change the GraphQL endpoint the app uses in
[`src/config.js`](./src/config.js).


## Contributing

Contributions of all kinds are welcomed but please attach screenshots to your
pull requests (ideally for both platforms) showing new functionality and/or an
explanation of what you did to verify your change doesn't cause a regression.


#Windows Guide Dev environment setup

The steps below are based off the guide outlines here,
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html

- Powershell Prompt (run as admin)
```choco install -y nodejs.install python2 jdk8```

	```npm install -g react-native-cli```


- Download Android Studio - https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html
- Clone Git Repo to your machine
- Android Studio - Open existing Project in Android Studio > client folder.
- DO NOT Upgrade **GRADLE** version as per prompt
- Android Studio  > Tools > Android > SKD Manager
- Tick "show package details" on each tab as you open them
- Untick all items that do not match below to avoid conflicts

**SDK Platforms**
Android 6.0 - Google APIs
Android 6.0 - Android SDK Platform 23
Android 6.0 - Sources for Android 23
Intel x86 Atom System Image
Intel x86 Atom_x64 System Image
Intel APIs Intel x86 Atom System Image
Intel APIs Intel x86 Atom_64 System Image
Android 6.0 - Performance (Intel Â® HAXM)
Android 6.0 - Android Virtual Device

**SDK Tools**
Android SDK-Build-Tools - 23.0.1
Android Emulator - 26.1.4
Android SKD Platform Tools - 26.0.2
Android SDK Tools 26.1.1
Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAMX Installer)
Android SUpport Repository - 47.0.0
Google Repository - 58

- Setup Android "AVD"  - Tools > Android > Setup AVD
	- 86 Images > Marshmellow API = v23 

**Test Compile app** Powershell (Run as admin) - You will need to change directory to suite yourself

```cd c:\availability-poc\client\android
./gradlew clean
cd C:\availability-poc\client\
react-native run-android```

If all goes to plan, it will error out saying "No AVD" available.

**Run in emulator**
- Android Dev Tools > AVD > Start > Wait for it to book
- Run compile as per steps above

To "reload" the app after you make changes, you need to push R twice while you have the emulator selected.
