- DO NOT Upgrade **GRADLE** version as per prompt
- Android Studio  > Tools > Android > SKD Manager
- Tick "show package details" on each tab as you open them
- Untick all items that do not match below to avoid conflicts

- Setup Android "AVD"  - Tools > Android > Setup AVD
	- 86 Images > Marshmellow API = v23 

**Test Compile app** Powershell (Run as admin) - You will need to change directory to suite yourself

```cd c:\availability-poc\client\android
./gradlew clean
cd C:\availability-poc\client\
react-native run-android```

If all goes to plan, it will error out saying "No AVD" available.

**Run in emulator**
- Android Dev Tools > AVD > Start > Wait for it to boot
- Run compile as per steps above

To "reload" the app after you make changes, you need to push R twice while you have the emulator selected.
